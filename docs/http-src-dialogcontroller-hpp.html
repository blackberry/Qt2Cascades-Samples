     * The DialogController is a helper class that is used to implement
     * dialog-like behavior with QML.
     * It blocks the execution flow when opening a dialog by starting a
     * nested event loop. The event loop will handle all user input while
     * the dialog is open and will be quit when the dialog is closed.
