    \title XML HTML Info Example

    \section1 Description

    The XML HTML Info example provides statistics about the content of HTML files.

    The files are parsed using a QXmlStreamReader object. If the file does
    not contain a well-formed XML document, a description of the error is
    reported.

    \section1 Basic Operation

    Reading XML is handled by an instance of the QXmlStreamReader class, which
    operates on the input file object:

    \snippet htmlinfo/src/htmlinfo.cpp 0

    The work of parsing and the XML and extracting statistics is done in a
    while loop, and is driven by input from the reader:

    \snippet htmlinfo/src/htmlinfo.cpp 1

    If more input is available, the next token from the input file is read
    and parsed. The program then looks for the specific element types,
    "title", "a", and "p", and stores information about them.

    When there is no more input, the loop terminates. If an error occurred,
    it is reported to the UI:

    \snippet htmlinfo/src/htmlinfo.cpp 2

    If no error occurred, the example makes the statistics available to the UI.
